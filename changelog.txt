 vanilla bed texture.
0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0-2024-08-19: made model, updated texture to also work on model
 & vanilla both. Looked through the render code for bed, and where its atlas
 was stitched. Decided to bypass for now.

0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0-2024-08-21: CGA texture variety made. JSON model version made
 for non-placed contexts. Textures unstitched for JSON models.

0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0-2024-08-23: moved forge changelog/credits/license/readme
 to their own.
 Made changelog.txt.
 Finished implementing two special cases (one stupidSpecialCase) to add the two
 special nondye colors: Beddium and Bright Cyan (aqua)
 And, ported the load from block atlas back over to the first 16, so vanilla
 beds can have their own texture again.
